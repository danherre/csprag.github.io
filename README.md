## Contributing

The site itself uses [GitHub Pages][], [Flask][], and [Frozen-Flask][].

Before contributing, please check [open issues][] and create a [new issue][] if a one for your proposed contribution does not exist.

Content for the website is written in [Markdown][].
To contribute to the [reference page][], navigate to `reference/static/commands` and then to the specific section and edit an existing `.md` file or create a new one.
For example, to edit the `cd` reference, edit `reference/static/commands/basics/cd.md`.

In order to build the site locally on your computer, there are a number of dependencies to resolve first.
Make sure you're in a python 3.7 virtual environment, then run the following in your terminal:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=reference
export FLASK_ENV=development
python setup.py develop
flask run
```

Alternatively, just run the setup script provided.

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
run.sh
```

For more information on setting up, see [GitHub's guide][gh docs] or [Flask's documentation][flask docs].

After making a change and verifying that it works, please submit a [pull request][].
